# complex
Implementation of complex numbers for C++ by Rok Medves

# To do

- [x] Create a Makefile
- [x] create a complex.cpp
- [ ] make a namespace with functions like complex power, exponential, sine, cosine
- [ ] enable Complex * double multiplication etc...
- [ ] finish off complexFunction namespace with log, sin, cos, pow etc.
- [ ] maybe a feature to plot it all in gnuplot some time?
